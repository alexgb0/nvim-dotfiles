# nvSuckless
A minimal, suckless neovim config.

## Overview
nvSuckless is an extreamly simple config files for neovim. The configs are based on lua. It offers

1. Language server (using built in LSP)
2. Auto complete (using nvm-cmp)
3. Snippets (using vim-vsnip)
4. File explorer (using nvim-tree)

The package manager used is 'packer'.

## Normal features missing
Since this is a suckless, non-bloated config, many things that other configs offer are missing, the user is free to add them if the need it.

Personally, I think most of the following things are gimmicks that you don't really need it anyway, or **the complexity to add them is not worth it**.
